# üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis ‚Äî EDA and Correlation Study

This project explores the **Wine Quality dataset** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover the chemical characteristics that influence wine quality.

The analysis uses the dataset `winequality-red.csv` (synthetic version based on real data) and reproduces key insights through visualization and correlation analysis.

---

## üìä Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of wine quality scores.
- Explore relationships between physicochemical features (acidity, alcohol, sulphates, pH, etc.).
- Identify variables most correlated with wine quality.
- Visualize data patterns with histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and a correlation heatmap.

---

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## üìà Main Visualizations
1. **Quality Distribution (Bar Plot)** ‚Äì shows the frequency of each quality score.  
2. **Correlation Heatmap** ‚Äì highlights positive and negative relationships among variables.  
3. **Histograms** ‚Äì visualize feature distributions such as *fixed acidity* and *alcohol content*.  
4. **Scatter Plot (Alcohol vs pH)** ‚Äì color-coded by wine quality to reveal chemical trends.

---

## üîç Key Insights
- Most wines are rated between **5 and 6**, indicating medium quality.  
- **Alcohol** has a **strong positive correlation** with quality.  
- **Volatile acidity** shows a **negative correlation** with quality.  
- pH and fixed acidity are inversely related.  

These relationships are consistent with real-world enological findings.
